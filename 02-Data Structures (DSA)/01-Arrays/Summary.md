# 📚 Arrays in Data Structures

Welcome to the **Arrays** section of the `mypython-tutorials` repository! This folder dives deep into one of the most fundamental data structures: **Arrays**. Arrays are the backbone of many algorithms, and understanding their implementation is crucial for solving a wide range of computational problems. 🚀

## 📂 Folder Structure

Here is what you can find in this folder:

### 1. **Initialization and Basics**  
Learn how to initialize arrays, perform basic operations, and understand how arrays work under the hood.

### 2. **Projects**
- `dynamic-array-simulator.py`: A project simulating dynamic array resizing.
- `image-pixel-processor.py`: A script demonstrating array manipulation in image processing.
- `summary.md`: A markdown file summarizing the concepts and projects.

### 3. **Searching Algorithms** 🔍
Efficiently find elements in arrays using these algorithms:
- `binary_search.py`: Standard binary search implementation.
- `binary_search_recursive.py`: Recursive approach to binary search.
- `linear_search.py`: Simple linear search implementation.

### 4. **Sorting Algorithms** 🔢
Sort your arrays using these commonly used algorithms:
- `bubble_sort.py`: Bubble Sort implementation.
- `selection_sort.py`: Selection Sort implementation.
- `insertion_sort.py`: Insertion Sort implementation.
- `quick_sort.py`: Quick Sort implementation.
- `merge_sort.py`: Merge Sort implementation.
- `bucket_sort.py`: Bucket Sort implementation.

### 5. **Real-World Applications** 🌟
Explore how arrays are used in real-world scenarios with practical examples in `real-world-applications.py`.

## 🛠️ Upcoming Content
I’ll also be sharing solutions to **LeetCode questions** for arrays in this folder. This will help you practice and solidify your understanding of array-based problems. Stay tuned! 💪

## 🌟 Why Arrays?
- Arrays provide a foundation for understanding more complex data structures.
- They are highly efficient for accessing and storing data in a contiguous memory block.
- Learning arrays sets the stage for mastering algorithms like searching, sorting, and more.
