# Project Summary

This repository contains two key projects: **Dynamic Array** and **Image Preprocessor**.

---

## Project 1: Dynamic Array üìä

The **Dynamic Array** project implements a flexible array-like data structure that can automatically resize as elements are added or removed. It mimics the behavior of a dynamic array, ensuring optimal memory usage and constant-time access to elements. The project supports efficient insertion, deletion, and dynamic resizing to accommodate changing data sizes.

### Key Features:
- Dynamic resizing based on data insertion.
- Efficient memory usage with reallocation.
- O(1) access time for elements.
- Supports insertion and deletion of elements.

## Project 2: Image Preprocessor üñºÔ∏è

The **Image Preprocessor** project provides a set of tools for processing images, making them ready for machine learning and computer vision tasks. It includes functionalities for resizing, cropping, normalizing pixel values, and converting image formats. The project helps streamline the preprocessing of images for model training and evaluation.

### Key Features:
- Resize images while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Crop images to focus on relevant content.
- Normalize pixel values for model compatibility.
- Convert images between different formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
