    Bucket Sort Algorithm:

    Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of the array into a number of 
    equally spaced sub-arrays called buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually using another sorting algorithm 
    or recursively, and the sorted elements are concatenated back together to form the final sorted array.

    **How Bucket Sort Works:**
    1. The input array is divided into 'k' equal-sized buckets based on the value of the elements.
    2. Each bucket is then sorted individually using an efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., insertion sort).
    3. The elements from all buckets are concatenated into a single sorted array.

    Parameters:
        arr (list): The list of elements to be sorted.
        k (int): The number of buckets to be used for sorting. Higher values of k lead to more fine-grained divisions.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array in ascending order.

    **Time Complexity:**
    - Best Case: O(n + k) (when the elements are uniformly distributed)
    - Worst Case: O(n^2) (when all elements fall into the same bucket, leading to a poor sorting scenario)
    
    **Space Complexity:**
    - O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the number of buckets used.
      This is because we need additional space to store the buckets and the result array.

    Example Usage:
    ```python
    arr = [0.42, 0.32, 0.23, 0.75, 0.89, 0.23]
    k = 5
    print(bucket_sort(arr, k))
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    [0.23, 0.23, 0.32, 0.42, 0.75, 0.89]
    ```

    **Edge Cases:**
    1. **Empty Array:** If the input array is empty, the function will return the empty array.
    2. **Single Element Array:** If the array contains only one element, it is already sorted and will be returned as is.
    3. **Array with All Equal Elements:** If all elements are the same, they will all fall into the same bucket, and the algorithm will sort the bucket accordingly.

    **Algorithm Efficiency Considerations:**
    Bucket Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm when the input array elements are uniformly distributed over a range. 
    However, it can perform poorly if the elements are not well-distributed, as it may cause one or more buckets to contain many elements, leading to a sorting time complexity of O(n^2).

    In practice, Bucket Sort is often used for sorting data that is uniformly distributed over a range, such as floating-point numbers within a fixed interval [0, 1].
